## Polymorphisism
* Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. 
* It is the ability of a programming language to present the same interface for several different underlying data types and different objects to respond in a unique way to the same message.
<br><br>
Polymorphisism can be used in different programming languagaes such as:<br>
  * Ruby
  * Java
  * C++
  * Python <br><br>
#### 5 Types of Polymorphisism
1) Ad-hoc polymorphism in computer science
2) Parametric polymorphism
3) Subtyping polymorphism in object-oriented programming
4) Row polymorphism
5) Polytypism
